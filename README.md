📄 File Tracking System (FTS)
Track Your Files Seamlessly Across Departments Using QR Codes

🔍 Project Overview
The File Tracking System (FTS) is a digital solution built to track the journey of user-submitted files across multiple departments in an organization.

🔁 Real-time Stage Updates: Receive status updates like Submitted, In Review, Approved, or Rejected.

🧑‍💼 Role-Based Logins: Secure login system for Admins and Employees.

📂 Admin Control Panel: Create departments, assign files, and manage progress.
